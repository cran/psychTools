\title{Project Talent data set from Marion Spengler and Rodica Damian
}
\description{Project Talent gave 440,000 US high school students a number of personality and ability tests. Of these, the data fror 346,000 were available for followup. Subsequent followups were collected 11 and 50 years later.
Marion Spengler and her colleagues Rodica Damian, and Brent Roberts reported on the stability and change across 50 years of personality and ability. Here is the correlation matrix of 25 of their variables (Spengler) as well as a slightly different set of 19 variables (Damian).
This is a nice example of mediation and regression from a correlation matrix.
