\title{75 mood items from the Motivational State Questionnaire for 3032 unique participants}
\description{Emotions may be described either as discrete emotions or in dimensional terms.  The Motivational State Questionnaire (MSQ) was developed to study emotions in laboratory and field settings.  The data can be well described in terms of a two dimensional solution of energy vs tiredness and tension versus calmness. Alternatively, this space can be organized by the two dimensions of Positive Affect and Negative Affect. Additional items include what time of day the data were collected and a few personality questionnaire scores. 3032 unique participants took the MSQ  at least once, 2753 at least twice, 446 three times, and 181 four times.  The 3032 participants also took the \code{\link{sai}} state anxiety inventory at the same time.  Some studies manipulated arousal by caffeine, others manipulations included affect inducing movies.

\details{The Motivational States Questionnaire (MSQ) is composed of 75 items, which represent the full affective space (Revelle & Anderson, 1998). The MSQ consists of 20 items taken from the Activation-Deactivation Adjective Check List (Thayer, 1986), 18 from the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS, Watson, Clark, & Tellegen, 1988) along with the affective circumplex items used by Larsen and Diener (1992). The response format was a four-point scale that corresponds to Russell and Carroll's (1999) "ambiguous--likely-unipolar format" and that asks the respondents to indicate their current standing (``at this moment") with the following rating scale:\cr
0----------------1----------------2----------------3
\cr
Not at all		A little		Moderately     	Very much \cr

The original version of the MSQ included 70 items. Intermediate analyses (done with 1840 subjects) demonstrated a concentration of items in some sections of the two dimensional space, and a paucity of items in others. To begin correcting this, 3 items from redundantly measured sections (alone, kindly, scornful) were removed, and 5 new ones (anxious, cheerful, idle, inactive, and tranquil) were added.  Thus, the correlation matrix is missing the correlations between items anxious, cheerful, idle, inactive, and tranquil with alone, kindly, and scornful. 

2605 individuals took Form 1 version, 3806 the Form 2 version.  3032 people (1218 form 1, 1814 form 2) took the MSQ at least once.  2086 at least twice, 1112 three times, and 181 four times. 
 
To see the relative frequencies by time and form, see the first example.

Procedure. The data were collected over nine years in the Personality, Motivation and Cognition laboratory at Northwestern, as part of a series of studies examining the effects of personality and situational factors on motivational state and subsequent cognitive performance. In each of 38 studies, prior to any manipulation of motivational state, participants signed a consent form and in some studies, consumed 0 or 4mg/kg of caffeine.  In caffeine studies, they waited 30 minutes and then filled out the MSQ. (Normally, the procedures of the individual studies are irrelevant to this data set and could not affect the responses to the MSQ at time 1, since this instrument was completed before any further instructions or tasks.  However, caffeine does have an effect.)  The MSQ post test following a movie manipulation) is available in \code{\link{affect}} as well as here. 

The XRAY study crossed four movie conditions with caffeine.  The first MSQ measures are showing the effects of the movies and caffeine, but after an additional 30 minutes, the second MSQ seems to mainly show the caffeine effects. The movies were 9 minute clips from 1) a BBC documentary on British troops arriving at the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp (sad); 2) an early scene from Halloween in which the heroine runs around shutting doors and windows (terror); 3) a documentary about lions on the Serengeti plain, and 4) the "birthday party" scene from Parenthood.

The FLAT study measured affect before, immediately after, and then after 30 minutes following a movie manipulation. See the \code{\link{affect}} data set.

To see which studies used which conditions, see the second and third examples.

The EA and TA scales are from Thayer, the PA and NA scales are from Watson et al. (1988).
Scales and items:

Energetic Arousal: active, energetic, vigorous, wakeful, wide.awake, full.of.pep, lively, -sleepy, -tired, - drowsy  (ADACL)

Tense Arousal: Intense, Jittery, fearful, tense, clutched up, -quiet, -still, - placid, - calm, -at rest  (ADACL)

Positive Affect: active, alert, attentive, determined, enthusiastic, excited, inspired,  interested,  proud, strong  (PANAS)

Negative Affect: afraid, ashamed,   distressed,  guilty,  hostile, irritable , jittery, nervous, scared, upset (PANAS)

The PA and NA scales can in turn can be thought of as having subscales:  (See the PANAS-X)
Fear:  afraid, scared, nervous, jittery    (not included  frightened, shaky)
Hostility: angry, hostile, irritable, (not included:   scornful,  disgusted, loathing 
guilt: ashamed, guilty,   (not included: blameworthy, angry at self, disgusted with self, dissatisfied with self)
sadness: alone,  blue,  lonely, sad,  (not included: downhearted) 
joviality: cheerful, delighted, energetic, enthusiastic, excited,  happy, lively,     (not included:  joyful)
self-assurance: proud, strong, confident,       (not included: bold,  daring, fearless )   
attentiveness:  alert, attentive,  determined  (not included: concentrating)

The next set of circumplex scales were taken  from Larsen and Diener (1992).  
High activation: active, aroused, surprised, intense, astonished
Activated PA: elated, excited, enthusiastic, lively
Unactivated NA : calm, serene, relaxed, at rest, content, at ease
PA: happy, warmhearted, pleased, cheerful, delighted
Low Activation: quiet, inactive, idle, still, tranquil
Unactivated PA: dull, bored, sluggish, tired, drowsy
NA: sad, blue, unhappy, gloomy, grouchy
Activated NA: jittery, anxious, nervous, fearful, distressed.

Keys for these separate scales are shown in the examples.  

In addition to the MSQ, there are 5 scales from the Eysenck Personality Inventory (Extraversion, Impulsivity, Sociability, Neuroticism, Lie).  The Imp and Soc are subsets of the the total extraversion scale based upon a reanalysis of the EPI by Rocklin and Revelle (1983). This information is in the \code{\link{msq}} data set as well.

\note{In December, 2018 the caffeine, film  and personality conditions were added. In the process of doing so, it was discovered that the EMIT data had been incorrectly entered.  This has been fixed.
